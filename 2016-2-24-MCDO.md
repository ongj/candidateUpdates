title: MCDO Candidate Subscription App
permalink: /MCDO/
---

Inline with the incoming election, we have created a web application hosted on Bluemix which aids in the dissemination of news, issues, and information regarding the candidates to the citizens of the Philippines.

MCDO is a Candidate Subscription App which integrates the Twilio and PostgreSQL services. Twilio is an application which has the ability to send and receive text messages and voice mail. This application is only concerned with the SMS Messaging feature. PostgreSQL allows us to save data entered by users in a database. The targeted users for this application are the Candidate Supporters and Campaign Managers.

Candidate Supporters <br>
The Candidate Supporters (Public Users) first go to the Web Application hosted by Bluemix. Then they register and choose which candidates they want to subscribe to. Subscribing to a candidate includes the user into a list of people who will be notified with news updates regarding the candidate whenever there is a news blast sent by the Campaign Manager.

Campaign Managers <br>
Campaign managers are registered and are certified to represent their corresponding candidates. They register on the web application and include which candidate they are managing. Through the web application, they have the ability to send information about their candidate to the list of public users who are subscribed to their candidate.

This application targets the candidates, campaign managers, and the voters. It enables a platform for the candidates and their campaign managers to update their audience with their current happenings e.g. campaign schedules, important press releases, and other messages. It also targets the voters because they get to follow their chosen candidates.

We believe that this will be an efficient way for candidate supporters to subscribe to their candidates because of the lack of good internet connection in the country. With this application, the candidate supporters would only need to use internet connection to register and subscribe to the candidates through the web application. After this, all updates will be sent through text message and not an internet connection.

In this tutorial you will deploy a MCDO: Candidate Subscription App in Bluemix.



#### Create a Twilio account
1. Go to [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) and click the `Sign Up` button on the upper right.

2.  Register by filling up the text fields, and choose the following options in the drop down list.

	||||
	|---|---|---|
	| **What are you building?** | SMS Alerts|
	| **Choose your language** | Java |
	| **Which product do you plan to use first?** | Programmable SMS |
	
	<br>
4. Click `Get Started`.

5. Before proceeding to use Twilio's services, Twilio has to verify one phone number from you. Choose `Philippines` (area code +63) and in the textbox, enter the rest of your phone number (ex. 9171234567).

6. After this you will be redirected to a verification page. Once you receive the verification code in your phone, enter it in the text box and proceed.

8. On the current page, click `Get your first Twilio Number` and click `Choose this number`. Take note of your new number and click `Done`.

9.  In order for the Twilio service in Bluemix to work, it requires your Twilio account's `Auth Token` and `Account SID` both which can be found [here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account) by clicking `Show API Credentials`. List down both of these credentials, as you will be needing this when binding Twilio to your Bluemix app.

#### Setting Up the Twilio Service
The implementation of the MCDO App assumes that we have a Paid Account. Paid accounts are allowed to send messages to unverified phone numbers. To simulate this with a free account, we are going to verify numbers in order to be able to send messages to them. 

1. To send messages to Philippine numbers, enable it [here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international/sms).

2. If you intend to send messages to phone numbers besides the one you registered when you created your account, you can verify them [here](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/verified) and clicking `Verify a Number`.


	>In the MCDO web application, users will have to provide a mobile number as they register. If we had a paid account, this user would not need to create a twilio account to receive messages, and the registration in the web application is sufficient enough to receive updates because paid users can send messages to unverified phone numbers. To simulate this with a trial account, the numbers entered into the user registration page of MCDO web application are numbers verified by our twilio user.

#### Copy MCDO Sample application from Github
Copy the repository that contains the application that you will deploy.
<br>
1. Create the directory `hackathon-mcdo`, then go to the created directory.

```text		
>mkdir hackathon-mcdo
>cd hackathon-mcdo
```
<br>
2. Clone the Github Repository with the MCDO App from [https://github.com/ongj/candidateUpdates](https://github.com/ongj/candidateUpdates)

```text		
>git clone https://github.com/ongj/Candidatesupdate
```
<br>
3. Go to the directory containing the project.

```text		
>cd Candidatesupdate
```
<br>
#### Create the Web Application using Gradle and deploy it in Bluemix using the CF tool
<br>
1. Make sure you are in the project directory. <br>
2. Use gradle to solve library dependencies and create the web application.

```text		
>gradle assemble
```
<br>
3. Login to your bluemix account to use the CF tool

```text		
> cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net -s dev
```
<br>
4. Deploy  it to bluemix

```text		
> cf push hackathon-mcdo-<yourname> -m 512M -p build/libs/myapp.war
```
<br>
5. Go to the [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net) Website and Login.<br>
6. Go to the `Dashboard` Tab and click the widget of your application `hackathon-<yourname>`<br>
7. Click `Add a Service or API`<br>
8. In the Catalog page look for the `Twilio` service and click it.<br>
9. Rename the Service name to `Twilio-<yourname>` . At this point you will have to Enter the Account SID and Auth Token provided by Twilio.<br>
10. Click `Create`<br>
11. You do not need to Restage the Application when prompted because we will be adding another service.<br>
12. Go back and click `Add a Service or API` again. <br>
13. In the catalog page scroll down until you see the Bluemix Labs Catalog link, click it.<br>
14. Look for `postgresql` and click it.<br>
15. Rename the Service to  `postgresql-<yourname>`<br>
16. Click `Create`<br>
17. When asked to restage the application, click the `Restage` button.<br>

You have successfully deployed your MCDO Application
